# BSL_Interpretor_preview
Here is where I show off my BSL interpreter project. The actual project is my Degree dissertation so I cant show it fully before its submitted without breaking academic rules. This is the early prototype I used to prove to my supervisor that I could do this ambitious project. For those interested in full demos of the full version contact me.
